# Pesto Matrimony

There are many matchmaking services in the market. Superficially, it may appear that a central matchmaking service having prospective brides & grooms from all nationalities, religions/communities is enough, but this one-size fits all approach is over-optimistic and impractical. It would work only for a small percentage who are seeking alliances without restrictions on mother tongue, religion, nationality, etc. This is not the case for the majority.
